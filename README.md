# BitVector

A class for binary vectors, that stores bits. The motivation behand the project is that in cryptography and coding theory there is a need for a datatype that can handle strings of bits. Besides storing and manipulating individual bits through set and get, it should alse be possible to do some basic computations on entire vector. 

## Note!
The intention of the class is not to be used in production code. Instead, it can be used in research projects in fields that manage binary vectors and need to do some computations.
